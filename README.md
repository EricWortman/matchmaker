# matchmaker
HTML structure built with "Matchmaker for the web" video 1 and 2 in Programming Together.

ChatGPT did help with the conditional statements and conditional image Javascript programming but I was able to modify it for what I needed.

I ran into another issue where the conditional image left a broken link display until the button was pushed so ChatGPT helped me hide that image until activated.

Drake did not OK his likeness but I can deal with that later
